<h1>Functions vs Methods in JavaScript</h1>
<p>A function is a standalone block of code that performs a specific task, while a method is<br>
a function that is associated with an object.</p>
    <script>
    // a funtion perfoms a task and can be used independently

    function greet(name) {   //greet is the function and can be called anywhere in the code
        return"hello," + name +"!";//it can also be defined outside of an object and can be called on its own
    }

console.log(greet("Faith"));

    // a method is a function that is a property of an object

    let person = {
        name: "Faith",
        greet: function() { //it uses the function keyword but is defined within an object
            return "Hello, " + this.name + "!";//it uses this to refer to its own object
        }
    };
    // person is the object, greet is the method

    //  DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOOPS
    // while loop
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "grape"];
let i = 0;

while (i < fruits.length) {
  console.log("Fruit: " + fruits[i]);
  i++;
}


// for each
let cars = ["Toyota", "BMW", "Mercedes", "Honda", "Ford"];

cars.forEach(function(car, index) {
  console.log("Car " + (index + 1) + ": " + car);
});

// do...while
let basket = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "grape"];
let counter = 0;

do {
  console.log("Fruit: " + basket[counter]);
  counter++;
} while (counter < basket.length);
