<h1>Functions vs Methods in JavaScript</h1>
<p>A function is a standalone block of code that performs a specific task, while a method is<br>
a function that is associated with an object.</p>
    <script>
    // a funtion perfoms a task and can be used independently

    function greet(name) {   //greet is the function and can be called anywhere in the code
        return"hello," + name +"!";//it can also be defined outside of an object and can be called on its own
    }

console.log(greet("Faith"));

    // a method is a function that is a property of an object

    let person = {
        name: "Faith",
        greet: function() { //it uses the function keyword but is defined within an object
            return "Hello, " + this.name + "!";//it uses this to refer to its own object
        }
    };
    // person is the object, greet is the method
</script>
